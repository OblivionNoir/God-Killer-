-For status effects and buffs, add a filter over the character image. Red for debuffs, blue for buffs, a combination of both for BOL. Like a real game would do. Not a million text boxes. Save the text box only for damage dealt by you. 
-Convert stat lists to objects for each character
-Cannot use multiple attacks at once. Set an attack active state to prevent this. Exceptions are My Turn, Broken Mirror and defend or anything else that waits in the background.
-Could probably clean some things up with ternaries 
-Make those 3 lines that get written for every attack into a function that takes in the image src
-Much of this can become functions and shorten the file size
-css file is messy. Less IDs, more classes. Sve the IDs for JS
-Gradual transitions as opposed to images just popping in
-Keep all the numbers as int. No decimals

-Hover over attacks for descriptions
-resize all backgrounds to 16:9 so they fit properly
-replace all "visibility" with "display"
