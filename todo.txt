-Cannot use multiple attacks at once. Set an attack active state to prevent this. Exceptions are My Turn, Broken Mirror and defend or anything else that waits in the background.
-Could probably clean some things up with ternaries 
-add items so characters can still be revived if l mage dies
-css file is messy. Less IDs, more classes. Sve the IDs for JS
-Gradual transitions as opposed to images just popping in
-Keep all the numbers as int. No decimals

-Hover over attacks for descriptions
